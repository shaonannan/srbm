% this function implements the minimum probability flow objective function
% and gradient for a fully connected Ising model.  see
% http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4779
%
% This code differs from K_dK_ising.m in that every state is compared to
% one more state than in K_dK_ising.m.  This additional state is the
% all-bits-flipped state.  This additional comparison significantly
% improves performance in cases (such as neural spike codes) where
% activation is extremely sparse, because it allows the MPF algorithm to
% correctly weight states where many units are turned on.
%
% this code is written under the greatly accelerating assumption that
% samples in the data vector differ from each other by more than one bit
% flip (see http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4779).  this is nearly always true
% for large systems, but means you'll get funny answers if you do a test
% run with a system of only a few units with lots of data.
